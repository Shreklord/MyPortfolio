          Hello, Iâ€™m Anthony, a Junior Computer Science student at the
          University of South Carolina. I'm a Software Engineer passionate about
          making innovative applications and websites. My journey into
          programming began at 17 when I discovered the thrill of bringing ideas
          to life through code. I'm particularly drawn to projects that
          challenge me to explore new technologies and problem-solving
          approaches. Im excited to delve deeper into the realms of Full Stack
          Website Development and continue honing my skills.
